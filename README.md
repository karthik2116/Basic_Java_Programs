1. ARMSTRONG : Check whether a number is armstrong or not.  The program uses a while loop to find the sum of the cubes of each digit of the number.
               If the sum of the cubes is equal to the original number, then the number is an Armstrong number. 
               The program then outputs whether the number is an Armstrong number or not.


3. PALINDROME : 121 = 121
